# Things we might do next time

- Add "goal for today" (give a lightning talk)
- Add a warm-up activity
- Update the outline, or ditch it and add timing comments into speaker notes
- Have handouts as a workbook rather than single things
- Add space to the 5Ws and 1H handout to let people write on it more easily
