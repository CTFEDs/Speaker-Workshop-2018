Great workshop. Perhaps could have been a bit longer.

Thanks for the advice and resources.

I think maybe limit topics to five or so to force a choice instead of spending 5 minutes choosing a topic.

Maybe that will speed up the process (choosing one of prescribed topics) so that we have more time for decisions/feedback share.

Loved the croissants.

Very insightful conversations.

Was really really helpful.

Timekeeping should be more strict but I really think you handled sidebar topics well.

Definitely got value out of this workshop :)

Really great and informative.

This was the first time to participate and it was really great and innovative.

I have never been able to give a speech in public or share thoughts with strangers but this workshop is the right place for me to be.

Workshop was awesome thanks! Learned a lot and will definitely be using in my work.

Well presented and always welcoming. I appreciate the time and effort. My biggest takeaway is being inspired to share and give back.

Helpful. Learned a lot of stuff from other people as well.

I would have loved to present to everyone as to gauge if I actually learned anything.

I'm really glad I attended this workshop and that the creators of it made the effort to make it happen.

We don't have something as good as this at work.

I walk away learning something today and it was nice to get these tips.
