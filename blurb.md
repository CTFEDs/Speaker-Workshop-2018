**Workshop: The fine (and fun!) art of public speaking**

After a short hiatus and many discussions, we're back! And this time round the workshop focus will be on public speaking and the fine art of presenting and sharing your knowledge with others.

**About the workshop**

We are trying our best to encourage and help people who are **under-represented** in tech (for example: women, LGBTQIA folk), because it's hard to make it in if you're on the outside. If this is you, we'd love you to come! If this isn't you, you're welcome as a guest of someone who is. Help us out and spread the word by inviting any under-represented peeps you know who might be interested!

Public speaking can be a bit intimidating at first, but it's a **super valuable skill to have**. Not only socially but also in terms of knowing how to promote yourself, your ideas, and advancing your career in tech. So we've put together a workshop to help you get started.

In the workshop we'll help **debunk some myths about speaking** (like "I have nothing to talk about" and "I don't have enough experience with the topic"), **share advice** from some top speakers across the world (on submitting a talk, preparing a talk, and giving a talk), and help you do some **practical exercises** to bring things together.

At the end of the session you'll have a **short bio** you can use for talk proposals, your LinkedIn profile or your own personal website! We'll also have helped you **generate some ideas for talks**, and you will have **given a lightning talk** to the rest of the attendees. Woo! \o/

**About you**

There are no pre-requisites for this workshop. You don't have to be an experienced developer, or have given a talk before. You don't even have to be a Front-end developer. Tell your friends!

**Directions**

As you enter Black River Park you will see the stairs to the entrance. Remember those :) 
The visitors bays are through the booms to the right as you enter. 
Once you have parked return to the stairs and enter the complex courtyard. You will see a lift on the far side of the courtyard. 
Take that to the second floor and New Media Labs is directly opposite the lift as you exit. Ring the buzzer.
