# Failure
# is okay! :)

---

## Failure
# is part of learning

^ don't know -> know
be patient, resilient

## Failure
# is just getting from "draft" to "more finished"

^ forgive yourself the horrors of your early draft

---

## Failure
# developers maturity

^ confidence,
knowing it will be okay anyway

---

## Failure
# is often not as bad as we think

^ be a praiseworthy pilot
being prepared takes some of the sting out of it

# Evolution,
# not revolution

# Get better in small steps

^ easier to do
more sustainable
revise, repeat
